Our strategy for the KSPD involves developing a comprehensive system that enables police personnel of varying ranks to collaborate effectively while maintaining autonomy. We categorize the police hierarchy into three levels: General View, Police View, and Super View.

In the General View, users are granted viewing permissions tailored to specific needs outlined in the statement. Progressing to the Police View level allows for the creation and editing of cases and tasks, facilitating the management and coordination of station activities. Officers assigned to tasks can delegate responsibilities and oversee the progression of cases, from initial filing to resolution.

Super View Officers have the ability to oversee multiple stations simultaneously, enabling them to monitor operations across different locations and assign tasks accordingly. This approach also enables police stations to upload resources, including equipment and personnel, for centralized monitoring and tracking of availability.

Additionally, leveraging surrounding data and provided datasets, we aim to deliver analytics on resource utilization, providing users with deeper insights. Integrated chat functionality enables seamless communication, allowing for real-time collaboration.
